# PetLocator  
## Brief Introduction  
This project is aimed at helping people find their lost pets. Users can set up electronical fence, navigate to their pets and send them to nearest hospitals.  
I use Raspberry pi as remote hardware, Android APP as client and Aliyun as server. Raspberry pi and server all run Python scripts to impliment their functions.  
## Reason of Creating This Project
When I'm in middle school, my dog was sent to a dock far from downtown because my dad want to get rid of its smell. There is a large reed field near the dock, the reed can even hide an adult. One night, my dog's new master called me in panic and tell me my dog had ran into the reed field and lost its sight from dusk.   
Even fortunately we found it in one hour, but I can never forget the feeling when it was finally found.  
## Communications
Thanks to any buddy who read my code. Because it's my first project which only cost my half of year, there may be some bugs in it. 
Anyone who find any bug commit issues or contact me by QQ 1603233411, much thanks.
